# Agentic Work System

The meta-project governing how the agentic work system's components integrate, evolve, and stay healthy.

This is a **workflow project** — it produces governance, integration, and operational clarity, not software.

## What Is the Agentic Work System?

A personal AI-augmented work system built on a layers-and-rings architecture:

- **Layers** (the work): Intent → Governance → Management → Operations
- **Rings** (the support): Governance, Intelligence, Knowledge, Control, Observability

See `docs/architecture.md` for the full reference.

## Components

| Component | What It Does | Location |

| **Knowledge Base** | Curated learnings, patterns, best practices | `~/code/_shared/knowledge-base/` |
| **Memory** | Cross-project, cross-session knowledge persistence | `~/code/_shared/memory/` |
| **Capabilities Registry** | Catalog of available skills, tools, agents | `~/code/_shared/capabilities-registry/` |
| **Krypton** | Personal AI chief of staff — cross-cutting intelligence | `~/code/_shared/krypton/` |
