# Intent: Agentic Work System

## Problem

The major components of the agentic work system — ADF, Knowledge Base, Memory, Capabilities Registry, Krypton, Link Triage, and Work Management — exist independently but lack a governing project to track system-level integration, health, and evolution. Each component has its own project workspace, but there's no meta-level coordination to ensure they work together as a coherent system.

## Desired Outcome

A coherent system where:
- Components are properly linked with defined communication protocols
- The rings (Governance, Intelligence, Knowledge, Control, Observability) operate at each layer
- Autonomy can scale as trust builds at each layer
- System health is observable across all components
- Integration gaps are identified and tracked
- Evolution is deliberate, not accidental

## Why This Matters

Without system-level governance, drift accumulates silently. Components evolve independently, interfaces degrade, and the architecture diagram becomes aspirational rather than descriptive. This project is the connective tissue that keeps the system honest.

## Success Looks Like

- Any agent session can orient itself within the system by reading this project's artifacts
- Component integration gaps are tracked and prioritized in the backlog
- System health is assessable without visiting every sub-project individually
- The architecture doc stays current with reality
- Ring instantiation is formalized and measurable

## Non-Goals

- This project does not build software — it governs the system
- This project does not replace component-level project management
- This project does not own any component's backlog
